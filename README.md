## Welcome to CricVis

Here, you can find a few visualizations, mostly pertaining to probably irrelevant statistics in cricket.
This page gets updated from time to time, with no particular schedule.

If you are interested in some visualization or seek help in doing something similar yourself, you can email at [cricvis@protonmail.com](mailto:cricvis@protonmail.com).

#### [Average variation](variation)

A basic look at the performance variation of players through a radar chart. Data has been scraped from the espncricinfo player profile pages, and is updated at the end of major series. Some basic thresholds were used to limit the players. Feedback welcome.

#### [Player separation](separation)

Inspired by [a post on r/cricket](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/cq1z2n/steve_smith_is_9_degrees_of_separation_from_the)
about degree of separation between Steven Smith from the Australian team that played its first test,
this is a visualization about who played with whom in tests, with an option to look for degree of separation
between any two players.

#### Work in progress

Some of the other ideas which will show up here are mentioned below. Since this is a hobby project, there's no timeline whatsoever.

1. Historical player (possibly teams as well) rankings.
